# Music-Synthesis
Piano simulator.

Note vectors are left application specific and up to the programmer.

My own note implementation (shown here) takes in two parameters. The first is the key number on the piano and the second is the duration of the note in seconds. The keys are ordered from left to right such that middle C (C4) is key number 40 and E4 is key number 44 (if you count blacks). If you'd like to see how I implemented notes, email me!
